# `react-language-switch`

A simple React component that allows toggling between two states, used in the example for language switching (e.g., French / English) with images (e.g., flags).

## Description

The `Switch` component allows toggling between two images (such as flags for different languages) based on the current state. It is ideal for creating visual switches for features like language change in a React application. The component is customizable with different images for each state and uses an `onClick` function to handle state changes.

## Features

- **Visual switch**: Allows changing states with an animation.
- **Customizable**: Uses custom images for each state.
- **Controlled state**: State changes are managed through `state` and `value` properties.

## Installation

You can install this component by adding it to your project via npm:

```bash
npm install devtools--btns
```
